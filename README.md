## Description
This project aims to create an interactive image generation model that converts sketches into realistic images.
The goal is to design a Pix2Pix-style GAN model, which users can interact with through a web interface.

All the code for this project can be found in the notebook `Sketch2Image.ipynb`.
This notebook includes the complete data pipeline and procedures for taining the model and generating images.

## Deployment
The model is deployed as `TF.js` model within a web interface which you can interact with
via the [link](https://seddik-turki.github.io/Sketch2Image/interface.html).
